## Product Requirements Document: Secure Patient Portal

**1. Title:**  project-create-a-comprehensive: HIPAA-Compliant Patient Portal

**2. Overview:**

This document outlines the requirements for "project-create-a-comprehensive," a secure and HIPAA-compliant patient portal built using FastAPI (backend) and React (frontend).  The application will empower patients to actively manage their healthcare, providing secure access to medical records, appointment scheduling, prescription management, and secure communication with healthcare providers. This improves patient engagement, reduces administrative burden on healthcare providers, and enhances overall healthcare efficiency.  The key value proposition is enhanced patient control, improved communication, and streamlined healthcare management within a secure and compliant environment.

**3. Functional Requirements:**

* **Patient Features:**
    * **Secure Login with MFA:**  Two-factor authentication (e.g., using Google Authenticator or similar) is mandatory.
    * **Medical Record Access:** View, download (PDF format), and search medical records (lab results, doctor's notes, imaging reports).
    * **Appointment Scheduling:** View, schedule, reschedule, and cancel appointments with integrated calendar functionality.  Integration with provider calendars is required.
    * **Prescription Management:** View prescription details, request refills, and track refill status.  Integration with a pharmacy system (to be determined).
    * **Secure Messaging:** Send and receive encrypted messages with healthcare providers.
    * **Secure File Upload:** Upload medical documents (e.g., imaging results from external sources).
    * **Notification Management:** Receive real-time notifications for appointment confirmations, lab results, and messages.
    * **Profile Management:** Update personal information (address, phone number, emergency contact).

* **Healthcare Provider Features (Role-Based Access):**
    * **Patient Management:** View and manage patient lists, access patient medical records.
    * **Appointment Management:** Manage appointment schedules, view patient calendars.
    * **Messaging:** Respond to patient messages securely.
    * **Prescription Management:** Approve or deny prescription refills.
    * **Document Management:** Access and manage uploaded patient documents.

* **Data Management:**
    * All patient data must be encrypted at rest and in transit.
    * Audit logs must track all user activity.
    * Data backup and recovery mechanisms must be in place.
    * Compliance with HIPAA regulations for data storage, access, and transfer is mandatory.

* **Integration Requirements:**
    * Integration with a chosen Electronic Health Record (EHR) system (to be defined).
    * Integration with a pharmacy system for prescription management (to be defined).
    * Integration with a payment gateway (optional, for future expansion).


**4. Non-Functional Requirements:**

* **Performance:**  Average response time under 2 seconds for all API endpoints.  High availability (99.99%).
* **Security:**  HIPAA compliance, secure authentication and authorization, data encryption (at rest and in transit), regular security audits, penetration testing.
* **Scalability:**  Ability to handle a large number of concurrent users and data volume.  Horizontal scalability architecture.
* **Usability:**  Intuitive and user-friendly interface, accessible to users with varying levels of technical proficiency.  Clear error messages and guidance.


**5. Technical Requirements:**

* **Technology Stack:** FastAPI (backend), React (frontend), PostgreSQL (database), Redis (caching).
* **API Specifications:** OpenAPI specification (Swagger) for API documentation and testing. RESTful APIs.
* **Database Schema:**  Detailed schema design will be developed based on the chosen EHR integration.  Data model must adhere to HIPAA regulations.
* **Third-Party Integrations:** EHR system (to be determined), Pharmacy system (to be determined), potentially a payment gateway.


**6. Acceptance Criteria:**

* **Each feature:** Unit and integration tests with 100% code coverage for critical paths.  End-to-end testing for user workflows.
* **Success Metrics:** User registration rate, active user count, average session duration, patient satisfaction surveys.
* **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):**  A group of representative users will test the application before launch.  Feedback will be incorporated into the final product.


**7. Release Criteria:**

* **MVP:** Secure login with MFA, patient access to medical records (limited subset), secure messaging with providers.
* **Launch Readiness Checklist:**  All functional and non-functional requirements met, UAT completed successfully, security audit completed, deployment plan finalized.
* **Post-Launch Monitoring:**  Regular monitoring of system performance, security, and user feedback.  Bug fixes and feature enhancements based on user feedback and usage data.


**8. Assumptions and Dependencies:**

* **Technical Assumptions:**  Availability of skilled developers proficient in FastAPI, React, and PostgreSQL.  Access to necessary infrastructure (servers, cloud services).
* **Business Assumptions:**  Sufficient funding for development and maintenance.  Collaboration and data sharing agreements with healthcare providers and EHR/pharmacy systems.
* **External Dependencies:**  Successful integration with the chosen EHR and pharmacy systems.  Reliable internet connectivity for users and the application.


**9. Risks and Mitigation:**

* **Technical Risks:**  Integration challenges with third-party systems, security vulnerabilities.  Mitigation: Thorough integration testing, security audits, penetration testing, robust error handling.
* **Business Risks:**  Delayed EHR/pharmacy system integration, insufficient funding.  Mitigation:  Detailed project planning, contingency planning, securing funding commitments.


**10. Next Steps:**

* **Development Phases:**  Requirements gathering (completed), design, development, testing, deployment, maintenance.  Agile methodology will be used.
* **Timeline Considerations:**  Detailed project timeline will be created based on resource availability and feature prioritization.
* **Resource Requirements:**  Developers (Frontend and Backend), QA engineers, database administrator, project manager.


**11. Conclusion:**

This PRD provides a comprehensive framework for developing a secure and HIPAA-compliant patient portal.  Successful execution requires careful planning, collaboration, and adherence to the outlined requirements.  The focus on security, usability, and compliance ensures the development of a valuable and reliable application that improves patient care and streamlines healthcare processes.
