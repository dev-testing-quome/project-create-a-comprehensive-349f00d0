# project-create-a-comprehensive

## Overview

This project implements a HIPAA-compliant patient portal application built using FastAPI and React.  The application allows patients to securely access their medical records, schedule appointments, manage prescriptions, and communicate with healthcare providers through encrypted messaging.  The system prioritizes security and data privacy, employing multi-factor authentication, role-based access control, and end-to-end encryption where appropriate.

## Features

**User-Facing Functionality:**

* **Secure Login with Multi-Factor Authentication:**  Robust authentication to protect patient data.
* **Medical Record Access:** View and download medical records securely.
* **Appointment Scheduling:** Schedule, reschedule, and cancel appointments with providers.
* **Prescription Management:** View prescriptions, request refills, and track prescription status.
* **Secure Messaging:** Communicate privately and securely with healthcare providers.
* **Secure File Uploads:** Upload medical documents such as test results or imaging scans.
* **Real-time Notifications:** Receive instant notifications for appointment confirmations and lab results.

**Technical Highlights:**

* **HIPAA Compliance:** Designed with adherence to HIPAA regulations in mind (Note:  Full HIPAA compliance requires a comprehensive security and privacy audit beyond the scope of this README).
* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**  Granular control over user permissions based on roles (patient, doctor, administrator, etc.).
* **End-to-End Encryption (where applicable):** Secure communication channels to protect sensitive information.
* **Data Encryption at Rest:**  Encryption of sensitive data stored in the database.
* **SQLAlchemy ORM:** Efficient and robust Object-Relational Mapping for database interactions.


## Technology Stack

* **Backend**: FastAPI (Python 3.11+), Uvicorn
* **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
* **Database**: SQLite (For Development and demonstration.  Production requires a HIPAA-compliant database like PostgreSQL with appropriate encryption)
* **ORM:** SQLAlchemy
* **Containerization**: Docker
* **Testing Framework:**  (Specify testing framework used e.g., pytest)


## Prerequisites

* Python 3.11 or higher
* Node.js 18 or higher
* npm or yarn
* Docker (optional, but recommended for development consistency)
* A text editor or IDE


## Installation

### Local Development

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd project-create-a-comprehensive

# Backend setup
cd backend
python -m venv .venv  # Using .venv for clarity and avoiding conflicts
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Frontend setup
cd ../frontend
npm install

# Start the application
# Backend (from backend directory)
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# Frontend (from frontend directory)
npm run dev
```

### Docker Setup

1.  Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed.
2.  Navigate to the project root directory.
3.  Run `docker-compose up --build`


## API Documentation

Once the application is running, you can access the interactive API documentation at:

* **API Documentation:** http://localhost:8000/docs
* **Alternative API Docs:** http://localhost:8000/redoc


## Usage

**Key Endpoints (Examples):**

* `/api/v1/patients`:  (GET) Retrieve a list of patients (requires authentication).
* `/api/v1/appointments`: (POST) Create a new appointment.
* `/api/v1/messages`: (POST) Send a secure message.


**Sample Request (POST /api/v1/appointments):**

```json
{
  "patient_id": 1,
  "provider_id": 2,
  "appointment_date": "2024-03-15T10:00:00",
  "reason": "Checkup"
}
```

**Sample Response (Successful Appointment Creation):**

```json
{
  "id": 3,
  "patient_id": 1,
  "provider_id": 2,
  "appointment_date": "2024-03-15T10:00:00",
  "reason": "Checkup",
  "status": "confirmed"
}
```

*(Note:  These are example endpoints. The actual API will have more comprehensive functionality.)*


**Common Workflows:**

1.  **Patient Login:**  The user logs in using their credentials and completes multi-factor authentication.
2.  **Appointment Scheduling:** The patient selects a provider and date, and the system checks for availability before creating the appointment.
3.  **Message Sending:**  Patients can send encrypted messages to their healthcare providers through the secure messaging system.
