# Developer Setup Guide - project-create-a-comprehensive

This guide outlines the setup process for developers working on the HIPAA-compliant patient portal application.  This project requires a strong understanding of security best practices and HIPAA regulations.  **Failure to adhere to these guidelines could result in serious legal and ethical consequences.**

## Prerequisites

* **Required Software Versions:**
    * Python 3.9+
    * Node.js 16+
    * PostgreSQL 14+ (or compatible version)
    * Docker Desktop (for Docker option)
    * Git

* **Development Tools:**
    * Git client (e.g., Git Bash, Sourcetree)
    * Text editor or IDE (see IDE recommendations below)
    * Postman or similar API testing tool


* **IDE Recommendations and Configurations:**
    * **VS Code:**  Highly recommended due to its excellent extension support for Python, JavaScript, and debugging. Install extensions for Python, ESLint, Prettier, and Docker.
    * **PyCharm:** A robust IDE specifically for Python development.  Offers excellent debugging and integration with various tools.
    * **WebStorm:**  A powerful IDE for JavaScript development, offering excellent support for React, Vue, or Angular (depending on the chosen frontend framework).


## Local Development Setup

### Option 1: Docker Development (Recommended)

This option simplifies setup by encapsulating the application and its dependencies within Docker containers.

1. **Clone Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd project-create-a-comprehensive
   ```

2. **Docker Setup:** Ensure Docker Desktop is installed and running.

3. **Development docker-compose Configuration:**  A `docker-compose.yml` file (located in the project root) will define the services (database, backend, frontend).  Example:

   ```yaml
   version: "3.9"
   services:
     db:
       image: postgres:14
       environment:
         - POSTGRES_USER=your_db_user
         - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_db_password
         - POSTGRES_DB=your_db_name
       ports:
         - "5432:5432"
     backend:
       build: ./backend
       ports:
         - "8000:8000"
       depends_on:
         - db
       environment:
         - DATABASE_URL=postgres://your_db_user:your_db_password@db:5432/your_db_name
         # ...other environment variables...
     frontend:
       build: ./frontend
       ports:
         - "3000:3000"
       depends_on:
         - backend
   ```

4. **Hot Reload Setup:**  (Specific instructions depend on your frontend framework -  Webpack, Vite, etc.)  Configure hot reloading within your frontend build process to automatically refresh the browser on code changes.  This often involves using tools like `nodemon` or similar.

5. **Build and Run:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d --build
   ```


### Option 2: Native Development

This option requires manual installation of dependencies.  It's less convenient but provides more control.

1. **Backend Setup (Python):**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Frontend Setup (Node.js):**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Database Setup:** Install PostgreSQL and create a database using the `psql` command-line tool.  Example:

   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE your_db_name;
   CREATE USER your_db_user WITH PASSWORD 'your_db_password';
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE your_db_name TO your_db_user;
   ```


## Environment Configuration

* **Required Environment Variables:**  A `.env` file (example shown below) will store sensitive information like database credentials and API keys. **Never commit this file to version control.**

   ```
   DATABASE_URL=postgres://your_db_user:your_db_password@localhost:5432/your_db_name
   SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key  # For backend security
   FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000 # For redirect URLs
   # ... other environment variables ...
   ```

* **Local Development `.env` file setup:** Create a `.env` file in the project root and populate it with your local development settings.

* **Configuration for Different Environments:**  Use environment variables to configure different settings for development, staging, and production environments.  Consider using a system like environment variable files or a secrets management service.


## Running the Application

1. **Start Commands:** (Adapt based on your chosen setup)
   * **Docker:** `docker-compose up -d`
   * **Native:**  Start the backend server (e.g., `python manage.py runserver`) and the frontend development server (e.g., `npm start`).

2. **Access Frontend and Backend:** Access the frontend at `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in your configuration) and the backend API through its specified port (e.g., `http://localhost:8000`).


3. **API Documentation Access:**  Use tools like Swagger or generate API documentation from your code using libraries like `drf-yasg` (if using Django REST Framework).


## Development Workflow

* **Git Workflow and Branching Strategy:**  Use Git for version control.  Employ a branching strategy like Gitflow (feature branches, develop branch, main branch).

* **Code Formatting and Linting Setup:** Use tools like `black` (Python) and `eslint` (JavaScript) to enforce consistent code style.  Integrate these tools into your IDE and CI/CD pipeline.

* **Testing Procedures:**  Implement unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.  Use a testing framework like `pytest` (Python) and `Jest` (JavaScript).

* **Debugging Setup:** Use your IDE's debugging tools or command-line debuggers to troubleshoot issues.


## Database Management

* **Running Migrations:**  Use database migration tools (e.g., Alembic for Python) to manage database schema changes.

* **Seeding Development Data:** Create scripts to populate your database with sample data for testing and development.

* **Database Reset Procedures:**  Create scripts to easily reset your database to a clean state.


## Testing

* **Running Unit Tests:**  Execute unit tests using your chosen testing framework (e.g., `pytest`).

* **Running Integration Tests:** Run integration tests to verify interactions between different components.

* **Test Coverage Reports:** Generate test coverage reports to track the percentage of code covered by tests.


## Common Development Tasks

* **Adding New API Endpoints:** Follow the API design guidelines and ensure proper authentication and authorization.

* **Adding New Frontend Components:**  Use your chosen frontend framework's component structure and best practices.

* **Database Schema Changes:**  Use database migrations to manage schema changes safely.

* **Adding Dependencies:**  Use your project's package manager (`pip` for Python, `npm` for Node.js) to manage dependencies.


## Troubleshooting

* **Common Setup Issues:**  Refer to the documentation of each component (database, backend, frontend) for troubleshooting common issues.

* **Port Conflicts Resolution:**  Change port numbers in your configuration files to resolve port conflicts.

* **Dependency Issues:**  Use your package manager's tools to resolve dependency conflicts.

* **Environment Variable Problems:**  Double-check your `.env` file and ensure that environment variables are correctly set and accessible.


## Contributing

* **Code Style Guidelines:**  Follow the code style guidelines specified in the project's documentation.

* **Pull Request Process:**  Create pull requests for code changes and follow the project's review process.

* **Issue Reporting:**  Use the project's issue tracker to report bugs and suggest improvements.


**Remember:** This is a template. You need to replace placeholders like `<repository_url>`, `your_db_user`, etc., with your actual values.  Adapt this guide to your specific project setup and chosen technologies.  Crucially, ensure all aspects of this application are rigorously designed and implemented with HIPAA compliance in mind.  Consult with legal and security experts to ensure full compliance.
